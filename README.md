Hello and thanks for reading this!

I created Pouptube as a project for Dev Bootcamp and I was met with immediate praise from faculty and classmates over the enjoyment factor that Pouptube provided.

I dig a LOT of digging through Google search to find the API call that would allow me to filter my search by view count. HOWEVER, the link was part of Youtube's 2.0 API.  Because of that, it has since been deprecated and the search functionality of Pouptube no longer works.  I am currently trying to find a way to implement the same by-viewcount search with the 3.0 API but have not had any luck.

To, view/use Pouptube, please use my account.

Have a look at the spectacularly awful and entertaininng videos my friends and I have uncovered.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and have a great day!
